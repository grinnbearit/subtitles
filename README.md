# subtitles

A Clojure library to read and write the srt subtitle format

## Usage

conforms to the protocol set by [clojure/clojure.data.csv](https://github.com/clojure/data.csv)

    (require '[subtitles.core :as srt])

Get a lazy seq of maps from an srt file:

    (srt/read-subtitles (reader "filename"))

or directly from a string:

    (srt/read-subtitles "1\n01:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000\nspeech\n")
    => ({:counter 1
         :start (Period. 1 0 0 0)
         :end (Period. 2 0 0 0)
         :text "speech"})

or from anything that implements `Read-Subtitles-From`, really

Uses [org.joda.time.Period](http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/Period.html) to keep track of time periods
